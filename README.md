  - ideas of what should be added to be added in comments
  - added an example of how we may define the semester profile structure
    - Type (M, E or A), Title (e.g. SoftwareEngineering),  Additional info {Due date, course code, etc}
    - deadlines (exams and assigments) come after the module line so that associated them is done easily in the constructor
  - exams and assignments now extend deadline, generic/user made deadlines may be required later on
Displaying the Gantt chart :: could use JFreeChart?
